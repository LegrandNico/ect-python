v0.2.3 (September 2022)
-----------------------

This release introduce two new components to Systole: the report module for fast preprocessing of ECG/PPG/Respiration dataset with interactive reports, and the Editor/Viewer for manual peaks correction and segments annotation. Both module integrate tightly with BIDS structured folders, but can also be used separately.

Changes
+++++++

- |Enhancement| |Fix| Rewrite py:`systole.correction.correct_missed` (now py:`systole.correction.correct_missed_rr`), py:`systole.correction.correct_extra` (now py:`systole.correction.correct_extra_rr`) and py:`systole.correction.correct_rr` to fix the index overflows caused by the insertion or deletion of intervals. All function are now jited, which should also provided performance improvements.
- |Fix| py:func:`systole.detection.interpolate_clipping()` was not handling thresholds correctly if the provided threshold is not the max/min of the time series.
- |Enhancement| |Feature| Add a py:`systole.utils.find_clipping` function to automatically find clipping threshold. This function is called by ppg_peaks when clipping=True and clipping_threshold="auto".
- |Feature| Plots module: Add a function py:func:`systole.plots.plot_rsp()` to plot respiratory signal.
- |Feature| Utils : Add a function py:func:`systole.utils.nan_cleaning()` to automatically interpolate NaN values in a given signal. This function can be called automatically (if required) and the begining of `ppg_peaks`, `ecg_peaks` or `rsp_peaks` by setting the parameter `clean_nan` to `True`. The default is `False`.
- Remove the default sampling frequencies for `ecg_peaks`, `ppg_peaks` and `rsp_peaks`. Do not resample if `sfreq` and `new_sfreq` are identicals.
- Remove py:`systole.recording.findOximeter`.
- |Feature| py:func:`systole.plots.plot_raw()` and py:func:`systole.plots.plot_r()` now accept an `events_params` parameter to plot events together with the instantaneous heart rate.
- |Enhancement| py:func:`systole.detection.ppg_peaks()`: change `noise_removal` to moving_average and add a `moving_average_length` parameter to control the window length.
- |Enhancement| |Feature| py:func:`systole.plots.plot_raw()` and py:func:`systole.plots.plot_r()` now accept a `bad_segments` parameter to help visualize annotated bad segments from the Editor/Viewer.
- |Feature| Add py:func:`systole.utils.norm_bad_segments()` and py:func:`systole.utils.get_valid_segments()` to help filtering part of the signal that are marked as bad.
